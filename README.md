## Summary

In the Console Battle application I got my hands dirty with C# for 
the first time.The application is built in the console and exemplifies
the board game Battleship. Creating classes and using them in reference
to each other was really cool once I got the hang of it. The GameBoard 
and Program classes had differing logic that needed to be separated.
While I did learn plenty in building the game, two areas really 
made a mark for me. Firstly coming up with the correct logic inside
the Program class with nested while loops enabled the game to take 
its course smoothly. Secondly randomly placing the ship on the board
was challenging as it's a bounded area. Overall I really enjoyed
building the application and growing my skill as a developer.
